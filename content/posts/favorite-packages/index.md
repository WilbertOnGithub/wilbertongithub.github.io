# Don't reinvent the wheel
An important skill as a software developer is knowing when to build something yourself and when to pull
in a external dependency. This is a delicate balance. 

When you pull in a dependency you need to ask yourself: 
*"What if this package would disappear tomorrow?"*.
Worst case would be that from now on you need to support it yourself. Plan accordingly - maybe add an abstraction to make 
it easier to replace the dependency in the future.

On the other hand, deciding to write everything yourself might be a interesting intellectual challenge but your customer who is
paying the bill will probably be less impressed :money_with_wings:

During the course of multiple projects and solving problems, you will encounter lots of tools and packages. People might recommend them to 
you or they are considered to be a de facto standard within your community.  

## My selection criteria
These criteria are subjective - it is what I consider to be important. These are not hard rules. 

- I prefer open source over commercial. I don't dismiss commercial software but all things being equal, open source would have my preference.
- [Libraries over frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NQUSbhqTLs). Frameworks tend to force you in a specific way of working while 
  with libraries you can pick what to use. Having said, sometimes you cannot avoid a framework.
- Packages/tools that are actively maintained are a plus.
- For a commercial project, I tend to avoid the more 'viral' [GPL-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) licenses. Not 
  because I personally dislike these licenses but because they are usually not accepted by customers/our organisation.

## Show me the list
This is my list of useful tools and Nuget packages that I use on a regular basis in 
projects (both my own and at work). I will update this list to keep it current and I can refer other people 
to it. The description in *italics* means that it is lifted directly from the project website.

### Syntactic sugar / patterns

solve common problems.
