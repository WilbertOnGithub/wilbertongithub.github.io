I'm currently employed (for over 10+ years already) as a software architect for [ICT Group](https://www.ict.eu/nl) where 
I primarily use .NET/C# to create solutions for our customers. Our projects range from small, single-use applications all the way 
up to large cloud-based projects.

Half-jokingly, I usually say that being a software architect means that you made and experienced enough mistakes to know 
what works and what doesn't. Given this experience, I have a pretty strong opinion on software development.

Writing is an important skill within software development. The ability to communicate ideas clearly to a diverse audience cannot be overstated.
I'm of the opinion that you need to *practice what you preach* and thus I decided to (re)start a blog. I mainly write for myself but hey, maybe 
someone else finds it interesting :wink:

Besides creating solutions, I love to share my knowledge. I'm an accredited trainer for the 
[iSAQB Foundation Training in Software Architecture](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-foundation-level/).
Next to that, I've created trainings for Git, both for [beginners](https://github.com/WilbertOnGithub/GitTraining_Beginners) and more 
[advanced usage](https://github.com/WilbertOnGithub/GitTraining_Advanced).

I love to attend [local user groups](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/nimma-codes-meetup-group/) both as a speaker and an attendant. If I find the 
subject matter interesting, you can find me there.

- I do some more personal blogging on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/weeveedee.bsky.social).
- I dabble a bit in [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wilbertvandolleweerd/) as a way to clear my head.
- Last but not least, some of my stuff (including the [source for this site](https://github.com/WilbertOnGithub/wilbertongithub.github.io)) is hosted on my [Github profile](https://github.com/WilbertOnGithub).
