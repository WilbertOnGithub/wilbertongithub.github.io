This repository contains the source code for my personal blog.

The blog consists of several parts:

- A static site managed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- The [Hugo PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
- The [Admonitions theme](https://github.com/KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions)
- A [Github workflow](https://github.com/WilbertOnGithub/wilbertongithub.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo.yml) that pushes new content to Github pages
